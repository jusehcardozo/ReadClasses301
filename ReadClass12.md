What is a Windows Domain and How Does It Affect My PC?

What is a Domain?
Windows domains provide network administrators with a way to manage a large number of PCs and control them from one place. One or more servers — known as domain controllers — have control over the domain and the computers on it.

Domains are generally made up of computers on the same local network. However, computers joined to a domain can continue communicating with their domain controller over VPN or Internet connection. This allows businesses and schools to remotely manage laptops they provide to their employees and students.

Is My Computer Part of a Domain?
If you have a home computer, it’s almost certainly not part of a domain. You could set up a a domain controller at home, but there’s no reason to do this unless you really want the experience. If you use a computer at work or school, there’s a good chance your computer is part of a domain. If you have a laptop provided to you by your work or school, it may also be part of a domain.

You can quickly check whether your computer is part of a domain or not. Open the Control Panel, click the System and Security category, and click System. Look under “Computer name, domain and workgroup settings” here. If you see “Domain”: followed by the name of a domain, your computer is joined to a domain.

Workgroups vs. Domains
Every Windows computer not joined to a domain is part of a workgroup. A workgroup is a group of computers on the same local network. Unlike on a domain, no computer on a workgroup has control over any other computer — they’re all joined together as equals. A workgroup doesn’t require a password, either.

Joining or Leaving a Domain
If your computer is part of a domain, joining or leaving the domain won’t generally be your job. If your computer needs to be on a domain, it will already be on a domain when it’s handed to you. You’ll usually need the domain administrator’s permission to leave a domain, so people who sit down to use a domain-joined PC can’t just leave the domain. However, you can leave a domain if you have local administrator access on your PC. You won’t have administrator access if you’re using a locked-down PC, of course.

What is a Windows Domain and How Does It Affect My PC?

What is a Domain?
Windows domains provide network administrators with a way to manage a large number of PCs and control them from one place. One or more servers — known as domain controllers — have control over the domain and the computers on it.

Domains are generally made up of computers on the same local network. However, computers joined to a domain can continue communicating with their domain controller over VPN or Internet connection. This allows businesses and schools to remotely manage laptops they provide to their employees and students.

Is My Computer Part of a Domain?
If you have a home computer, it’s almost certainly not part of a domain. You could set up a a domain controller at home, but there’s no reason to do this unless you really want the experience. If you use a computer at work or school, there’s a good chance your computer is part of a domain. If you have a laptop provided to you by your work or school, it may also be part of a domain.

You can quickly check whether your computer is part of a domain or not. Open the Control Panel, click the System and Security category, and click System. Look under “Computer name, domain and workgroup settings” here. If you see “Domain”: followed by the name of a domain, your computer is joined to a domain.

Workgroups vs. Domains
Every Windows computer not joined to a domain is part of a workgroup. A workgroup is a group of computers on the same local network. Unlike on a domain, no computer on a workgroup has control over any other computer — they’re all joined together as equals. A workgroup doesn’t require a password, either.

Joining or Leaving a Domain
If your computer is part of a domain, joining or leaving the domain won’t generally be your job. If your computer needs to be on a domain, it will already be on a domain when it’s handed to you. You’ll usually need the domain administrator’s permission to leave a domain, so people who sit down to use a domain-joined PC can’t just leave the domain. However, you can leave a domain if you have local administrator access on your PC. You won’t have administrator access if you’re using a locked-down PC, of course.


Top 10 Dangerous DNS Attacks Types and The Prevention Measures

Famous DNS Attacks Type:
DNS Cache Poisoning Attack
At first, we have the cache poisoning, it’s one of the frequent attacks, and its main aim is to take the web users towards the scam websites, as for example, a user accesses gmail.com through the web browser to consult their mailbox.

Distributed Reflection Denial of Service (DRDoS)
Distributed reflective denial of service (DRDoS) attacks concentrate on bringing down the availability of an asset within an authoritative volume of UDP acknowledgments. In some instances, the attacker would transfer a DNS, NTP, etc.

DNS Hijacking
DNS hijacking is a method in which an individual can divert to the doubtful DNS (Domain Name System). However, it may be achieved by using malicious software or unauthorized alteration of a server.

Phantom domain attack
Phantom domain attacks are kind of comparable to casual subdomain attacks. Thus in this kind of attack, the attackers attack your DNS resolver and overpower it to use up supplies to determine that’s what we name “phantom” domains, as these phantom domains will never respond to the queries.

TCP SYN Floods
An SYN Flood is a simple form of Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack that can target any operation related to the internet and thus implementing Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) services.
An SYN wave is a type of TCP State-Exhaustion attack that endeavors to utilize the connection element tables present in common infrastructure elements, for example, load balancers, firewalls, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), and the utilization servers themselves.

Random Subdomain Attack
This is not the most prevalent type of DNS attack, but it can happen from time to time on several networks. Hence, the random subdomain attacks can often be identified as DoS attacks, as their creation adheres to the same goal as simple DoS.

DNS tunneling
This is a cyber attack that is used to carry encoded data from different applications inside DNS acknowledgments and queries.
Meanwhile, this system wasn’t formerly created to attack multitudes, but to bypass interface controls, now it is mostly used to achieve remote attacks.
To implement DNS tunneling, attackers demand to gain entrance to a settled system, as well as access to an internal DNS server, a domain name, and a DNS authoritative server.

DNS Flood Attack
This is one of the most primary types of DNS attacks, and in this Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), the intruder will hit your DNS servers.
The main motive of this kind of DNS flood is to completely overload your server so that it cannot maintain serving DNS requests because all the treated DNS zones influence the purpose of resource records.

Domain Hijacking
This type of attack involves settings in your DNS servers and domain registrar that can manage your traffic away from the actual servers to new destinations.
Domain hijacking is usually affected by a lot of determinants related to exploiting a vulnerability in the domain name registrar’s system, but can also be performed at the DNS level when attackers take command of your DNS records.

Botnet-based Attacks
If we talk about the botnet, then let me clarify that it is a number of Internet-connected devices, and it can be practiced to implement a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack), which steal data, transmit spam, and enables the attacker to obtain access to the device and its connection.
